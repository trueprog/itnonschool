<h1 id="top">About the IT Non-School</h1>
<p class="lead">Learn the skills that will shape the future.</p>
<p>We are a volunteer organization with the goal to enable enthusiastic and talented young people to learn how to develop and operate IT solutions. We want to provide a platform to enable people to discover and unfold their talents in the IT field <em>without</em> tuition fees.</p>
<p>We do this by using the wealth of information, tutorials, and general resources already available on the Internet. It's up to you to use these resources to work on the real-world assignments we provide. We give you the opportunity to discuss questions with your fellow students and with our volunteers. We also rely on the students themselves to contribute and actively participate.</p>
<p>We expect our students to work in real-world jobs soon, and earn real money. This is our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>These are our core beliefs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
  <li>There are many out there who have the talent without knowing, or how know it but can't afford a formal education in the field.</li>
  <li>Schools today struggle to keep up with the speed of progress in the IT field because new developments pop up every week and often while school curricula are often focused on the skills relevant for the past decade.</li>
  <li>The Internet is full of useful information, although it is sometimes hard to find the most relevant and useful resources.</li>
  <li>Teamwork and ingenuity are more valuable than the ability to execute detailed instructions.</li>
  <li>Building professional credibility and a portfolio is more important than results in constructed exams.</li>
</ul>
