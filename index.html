        <p class="lead">Learn the skills that will shape the future.</p>
        <p>Information Technology, or &ldquo;IT&rdquo;, is a key technology of the 21st century. From games on your mobile phone to self-driving cars, everything in our lives is influenced by IT. Already now, corporations are desperately looking for skilled professionals that can help them flourish in this future. Beyond that, start-ups in Silicon Valley and elsewhere create new IT-based business ideas, while research into artificial intelligence and robotics push the boundaries of the possible even further.</p>
        <h2 id="about">What is the IT Non-School?</h2>
        <p>We are a volunteer organization with the goal to enable enthusiastic and talented young people to learn how to develop and operate IT solutions. We want to provide a platform to enable people to discover and unfold their talents in the IT field <em>without</em> tuition fees.</p>
        <p>We do this by using the wealth of information, tutorials, and general resources already available on the Internet. It's up to you to use these resources to work on the real-world assignments we provide. We give you the opportunity to discuss questions with your fellow students and with our volunteers. We also rely on the students themselves to contribute and actively participate.</p>
        <p>We expect our students to work in real-world jobs soon, and earn real money. This is our ultimate goal.</p>
        <p>These are our core beliefs:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>There are many out there who have the talent without knowing, or how know it but can't afford a formal education in the field.</li>
          <li>Schools today struggle to keep up with the speed of progress in the IT field because new developments pop up every week and often while school curricula are often focused on the skills relevant for the past decade.</li>
          <li>The Internet is full of useful information, although it is sometimes hard to find the most relevant and useful resources.</li>
          <li>Teamwork and ingenuity are more valuable than the ability to execute detailed instructions.</li>
          <li>Building professional credibility and a portfolio is more important than results in constructed exams.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="prereqs">What do I need to sign up?</h2>
        <p>There are a few prerequisites that you will need to meet.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-tpye: square">
          <li>You need to be between 18 and 25 years old. You will be asked to provide an official document (birth certificate or similar) as proof.</li>
          <li>Access to a computer with a decent screen and keyboard. Software development simply cannot be done efficiently on a mobile phone alone. The computer <em>can</em> be in an Internet cafe although we recommend that you use one where you can install software.</li>
          <li>Decent quality Internet access. We will communicate through instant messenger services. Also, a lot of the tools we will use are Internet based.</li>
          <li>A webcam. You don't need this permanently but for sign-up and for one-on-one mentoring sessions, this will be required.</li>
          <li>English language skills. We will communicate in English as this is the international language of IT. Don't worry if you're not perfect, barely anyone is. You will also get better throughout your journey with us.</li>
          <li>Enthusiasm. Remember that this non-school is run by volunteers and by the students themselves. Students who are not actively participating will be removed. There are no further consequences but you will not be able to participate anymore.</li>
        </ul>
